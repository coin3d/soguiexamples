This is probably the most brilliant program you have ever seen,
though unfortunately you are not likely to understand this right away. 
Foo will change your life, but you are not going to notice it. It
might seem to you that this is just a very primitive little
application that shows a view moving cubes. It is not. 
Foo will make you more beautiful, smart, successful, and charming.
You will no longer spill your coffee over your freshly ironed
trousers. You will get a parking slot directly in front of the office
entrance. You will wake up in the morning and feel greeat.
Tons of good things will happen to you just because of Foo. It's hard
to explain, but you'll see for yourself. And the best thing is, you
do not have to send this to everybody in your addressbook because
This Is For Real (TM). Enjoy!

Usage:
The goal of Foo is to take your mind off whatever is bothering you at
the moment. I've tried to model it after the Chinese mobiles -- you
know those constructions that have some spinnging wheels which move
in unrelated directions? The point of those is to show that chaos and
order are essentially the same phenomenon (three rotational movements 
following a very simple pattern resulting in a seemingly random
motion), and that sometimes you have to give up thinking to find an 
answer.

Use the mouse to introduce randomness into the system. The mouse
motion will add an additional motion vector. Fool around for a little
while, then lay back, concentrate on one of the little boxes, and
follow its path. (This is the important part.) Follow the box. Don't
look away. If your boss comes in, don't look away. If your phone rings,
don't look away. If your computer crashes, don't look away. Keep staring
at the blank screen and imagine the cube. You might try to disentangle 
the translations involved ;) or just enjoy being unproductive for a 
moment. Try it!

Press 'q' to quit the program.

There's an extra bonus to Foo. It can be used as "Hello World"
translator. You know -- "hello world" -- the words that every
programmer has their first program in whatever language spit out? I
think that's boring, so I had my first Coin application say "Hei
verden!" to me. To see some translations of these immortal words,
press <esc> to switch into selection mode, then click on the plane to
toggle the ">|<" off. You can now use 'T' to have your hello
world application in your language of choice. Neat, isn't it?

Enjoy!
