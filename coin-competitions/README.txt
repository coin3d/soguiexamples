The subdirectories below this directory contains the entries of our
"periodically" running internal Coin programming contest at Systems in
Motion.  Every 3 weeks we collect entries submitted and let our
non-programming personell decide upon a winner.  The author receives a
prize, which is usually some expensive booze. :-)

So be aware that the sourcecode for these examples might noe be very
"clean" and beautiful, as much of it has probably been written under
deadline pressure.
