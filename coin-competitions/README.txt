The subdirectories below this directory contains the entries of our
constantly running internal Coin programming contest at Systems in
Motion.  Every 3 weeks we collect entries submitted to the maintainer
of the SoGuiExamples CVS module and let our non-programming personnel
decide upon a winner.  The author receives a prize, which is usually
some expensive booze. :-)

Be aware that the sourcecode for most of these examples is written in
a quick'n'dirty fashion, as much of it has been hacked out under
deadline pressure.
