======

This module consists of generic example code on how you can use Coin and
the miscellaneous accompanying GUI toolkits.  The example programs are not
installed on the system since they are mostly useless, so you will need to
look for them in the build directories.

All sourcecode is licensed under the GNU GPL, with the exception that
Coin Professional Edition License licensees are allowed to use any and
all code for any purpose.

See <URL:http://www.coin3d.org> on how to obtain a Coin Professional
Edition License.
