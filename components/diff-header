This patch works around a bug with the Automake version we're using,
where the C linker mechanism is used instead of the C++ linker
mechanism.

The weird thing is that this only happens for the Makefile.in of the
examples/components/ directory -- so it probably has something to do
with either the particular succession of settings in the
examples/components/Makefile.am (which deviates a little from the
other examples/*/Makefile.am files), or with the conditional
compile/link settings. 20000513 mortene.
