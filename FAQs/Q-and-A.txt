Section 1. Transformations
==========================

Q1.1: I have a vector v=(x,y,z). I want to instantiate some geometry,
      for instance a SoCylinder that is parallel with vector
      v.  What's the "by the book" procedure for this?

A:    See the parallel.cpp.in code example.

Q1.2: I want to rotate N degrees around the v=(x,y,z)-axis, but it doesn't
      seem to work.

A:    It's a common mistake to mistakenly use the wrong SbRotation
      constructor.  The one that takes (SbVec3f, float) is the one to use,
      the one that takes (float, float, float, float) is for setting up
      the rotation from a quaternion.
