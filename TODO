Ideas for example programs:
===========================

*** Novice *************************************************************

        - animate transparency settings with engines


*** Intermediate *******************************************************

        - SoInterpolateFloat example-app: control the "value" field on
          an SoComplexity node controlling an SoSphere, connect the
          engine to the realTime global field

        - 3 So[Spot|Point|Directional]LightManips in a scene, each of
          them a separate R, G or B color, lighting up a simple scene
          with basic shapes (or a tiled polygon floor?)

        - all the transformation style manipulators in a scene, each
          attached to the same (complex) shape?

        - SoCallbackAction:
                - simple exporter for the geometry (to Povray?)
                - "explode" shapes into individual polygons and
                  animate them somehow

*** Expert *************************************************************

	- make a "billboard" nodetype ("SoBillboard"?) to show off the
          creation of new nodes

	- make an SoDisc or SoCircle nodetype to show off the creation
          of new shape nodes (with generateprimitives, picking etc)
